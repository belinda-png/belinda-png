Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Belinda, a backend developer dedicated to building the robust, scalable engine that powers exceptional digital experiences.

With a passion for clean architecture and efficient logic, I focus on creating powerful server-side logic, efficient data pipelines, and well-documented APIs. I focuse on solving complex problems and ensuring that the foundation of every application is as reliable as it is performant.
